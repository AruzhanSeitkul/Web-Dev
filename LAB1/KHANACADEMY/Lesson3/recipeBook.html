<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you have the right flour, the dough can easily be made in the microwave. First, you dissolve the dough, then you wrap it plastic wrap.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Cook it for one minute . Then you mix and cook it for one more minute .
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Then you gather the dough and cook it for about 30 more seconds until the dough is no longer white and slightly translucent..
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A little more time-consuming is the rolling out of the dough. Itâ€™s very, very sticky, but the use of cornstarch really helps. You roll the dough out very thinly, then cut circles.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The trickiest part is evenly wrapping the ice cream in the mochi. You need to do it quickly because the ice cream will immediately start to melt and once it wets the dough, the dough will no longer remain sticky enough to seal. It does take a few tries to get it right.

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Toss the potatoes with 1 tablespoon olive oil, the cumin seeds, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Spread in a large baking dish and roast until the potatoes begin to brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the brown sugar, lemon juice and red pepper flakes. Remove the baking dish from the oven, push the potatoes to the sides and arrange the chicken breasts in the middle. Season the chicken with salt and drizzle with the garlic mixture. Return to the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Remove from the oven; transfer the chicken to a cutting board and slice. Add the cilantro to the baking dish and toss with the potatoes. Serve the chicken with the potatoes and lemon wedges. Drizzle with the pan juices
